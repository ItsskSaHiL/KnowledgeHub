"Build a personal knowledge hub website that organizes and showcases all of my learnings, projects, and explanations across multiple domains of technology. The website should be modern, clean, responsive, and customizable for future growth."

üîπ Website Purpose

A single platform where I can upload and organize all my learning content (theory, code, projects, explanations, videos).

Acts as my personal learning archive, portfolio, and documentation hub.

Should be easy to navigate and scalable as I keep adding more knowledge.

üîπ Core Features

Domain Categories (Main Sections)
The homepage should list clear categories in ordered form. For example:

Embedded Systems

Bare-metal Programming

RTOS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr, etc.)

Device Drivers & Peripherals (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, etc.)

Bootloaders & OTA Updates

Protocols (CAN, LIN, Modbus, etc.)

Debugging, Tracing, Testing

AI & Machine Learning

Embedded ML (TinyML, TensorFlow Lite)

Deep Learning Basics

Optimization & Deployment on Edge Devices

Operating Systems

Linux Kernel Internals

Android OS Development

iOS/macOS Internals

RTOS vs Linux

Hardware Architectures

ARM Cortex-M, A

RISC-V

x86

GPU & Parallel Processing

Programming Languages

C, C++, Rust

Python, Shell Scripting

Assembly

Tools & DevOps

Git, GitHub

Jenkins, CI/CD

Docker, Virtualization

Jira, Version Control Workflow

Networking & Protocols

TCP, UDP, MQTT, HTTP/HTTPS

WiFi, BLE, LoRa, RF

Automotive Protocols (CAN, FlexRay, etc.)

Product Development

Product Design & Prototyping

Testing & Validation

Development Lifecycle & Agile

Simulations & Graphics

IoT & Cloud

IoT Architecture

Gateways & Edge Devices

Backend Servers & Databases

Cloud Deployment

Subsections

Each category should open into a structured page with topics, explanations, code snippets, diagrams, and videos.

Example: ‚ÄúEmbedded Systems ‚Üí RTOS ‚Üí Task Scheduling ‚Üí My Notes + Example Code + Video Explanation‚Äù

Content Management

Ability to easily add, remove, or edit topics.

Support for Markdown or WYSIWYG editor.

Option to upload PDFs, slides, and videos.

Search & Navigation

A search bar to quickly find content.

Sidebar / Table of Contents navigation.

Breadcrumbs for deep topics.

Customization

Ability to reorder sections.

Add tags/labels to topics.

Option to mark ‚Äúin-progress‚Äù or ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù.

Portfolio Integration

Special section for Projects (with GitHub/Repo links).

Case studies with explanation + outcomes.

üîπ Design & Style

Minimal, professional, clean UI.

Dark/light mode support.

Cards or grid layout for categories.

Icons for each domain (e.g., chip for Embedded, AI brain for ML, etc.).

üîπ Tech Stack (MVP Suggestion)

Frontend: React + Tailwind (or Next.js for scalability).

Backend (optional for now): Markdown-based content or a lightweight CMS like Strapi.

Hosting: GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify.

Database (future): MongoDB or PostgreSQL for advanced search.

üîπ Future Extensions

User authentication (if you want to make it private/public selective).

Video hosting inside site (or embed from YouTube/Drive).

Interactive coding snippets.

Notes syncing (like Obsidian ‚Üí Website).
